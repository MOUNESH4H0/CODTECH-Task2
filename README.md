Objectives:

Real-time Monitoring: Develop a system to continuously monitor temperature and humidity levels using a DHT sensor interfaced with an Arduino.
Data Display: Display temperature and humidity readings either on an LCD screen or through the Arduino Serial Monitor for easy visualization.
Accuracy and Reliability: Ensure accurate and reliable data collection from the sensor to facilitate informed decision-making based on environmental conditions.
User Interface: Provide a user-friendly interface to view and interpret the collected data, enhancing usability for both technical and non-technical users.
Expandability: Design the system for potential future expansions, such as remote data logging, IoT integration, or data analytics.

Key Activities:

Hardware Setup: Interface the DHT sensor with an Arduino board, ensuring proper electrical connections and sensor calibration.
Software Development: Write Arduino code to read sensor data, handle sensor errors, and manage data output to either an LCD display or the Serial Monitor.
User Interface Design: Design a simple yet informative display interface for temperature and humidity readings, potentially integrating graphical representations.
Testing and Calibration: Conduct thorough testing of the system to validate sensor accuracy, data consistency, and reliability over extended periods.
Documentation: Document the project design, implementation steps, and user instructions to facilitate future maintenance and replication.

Technologies:

Hardware: Arduino Uno (or compatible), DHT11 or DHT22 sensor, 16x2 LCD display (optional), breadboard, jumper wires, resistors.
Software: Arduino IDE, DHT sensor library, LiquidCrystal library (for LCD if used).
Languages: C/C++ for Arduino programming.
Development Tools: Serial Monitor for debugging and data visualization.

Project Outcome:

The project will result in a robust temperature and humidity monitoring system suitable for indoor environments, providing valuable insights into environmental conditions. It aims to demonstrate the integration of sensor technology with microcontroller platforms for practical applications in home automation, weather monitoring, and beyond.
